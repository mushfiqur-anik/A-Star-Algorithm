# A-Star-Algorithm

## Description of the problem
In this project a crime risk grid map was generated based on the crime rates data that was provided by the crime_dt.shp file which contains different crime rates data at different part of downtown Montreal. A* Heuristic Search algorithm was used to find the optimal path between any two given points (entered by the user) by avoiding the high crime areas in the grid.
